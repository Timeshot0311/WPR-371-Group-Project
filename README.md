## Overview
Project Title:
Dynamic Community Portal Website using Node.js, Express & EJS

Project Overview:
This project is a fully functional Community Portal Website developed using Node.js as the backend environment, Express.js as the server framework, and EJS as the templating engine. The portal consists of five dynamic pages:

Home: Displays a welcome message and placeholders for upcoming events.

About: Introduces the development team, loaded dynamically from the backend.

Events: Lists community events, including title, date, location, and image.

Contact: A simple form to capture user inquiries, storing submissions in a temporary in-memory array.

Thank You: Confirms message receipt after form submission.

The project implements modular routing, dynamic content rendering with EJS templates, and a well-organized folder structure. Collaboration and version control were managed via Git & GitHub, with Nodemon used during development for automatic server restarts.
